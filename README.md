# Real Estate Search
## By James Camacho
----
- To search by address, click "Browse All."
- To search by city name, click "Search by City."
- To search within a price range, click "Search By Price."
- You can pull up a map for each house.

Notes:

- I used Mockaroo to generate the data, and then a little Python to
generate the latitudes/longitudes (so they would be somewhere in Utah).
- The latitudes and longitudes do not match the cities the houses say they are in.
- The addresses are fake, so are the prices and square footage.
- The images of the houses were pulled from a Creative Commons search.
